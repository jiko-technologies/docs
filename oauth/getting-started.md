# Getting started

Contact Jiko support to receive credentials for an oauth client. You will need to provide the following details

1. Required [scopes](scopes.md)
2. Redirect URI - where to redirect after authentication flow is finished
3. Name of OAuth client - Will be displayed on the [consent screen](login-flow.md)

You will receive

1. client_id - a public identifier for your oauth client to send with your authentication requests
2. client_secret - a secret key that is used when exchanging an authorization code for an access token

Next: [Authorization code flow](authorization-code-flow.md)
